## **rxn** Reaction recommender for the synthesis of inorganic compounds

**WIP**

_rxn_ is a recommendation system for navigation of synthesis of 
inorganic materials based on classical nucleation theory 
and semi-empirical, data-driven approximations to its parts. Currently it
works with Materials Project data via its Rester API.

_rxn_ should in principle allow retrosynthetic analysis of target inorganic materials 
(i.e. laying out all the reaction steps necessary to arrive at the target). This is currently in progress.
