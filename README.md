## **rxn** Reaction recommender for the synthesis of inorganic compounds

**WIP**

_rxn_ is a recommendation system for navigation of synthesis of 
inorganic materials based on classical nucleation theory 
and semi-empirical, data-driven approximations to its parts. Currently it
works with Materials Project data via its Rester API.
